## The Game Design Document
Thomas: Actually doing the game design and working on the document was a lot of fun. It's been some time since I've been able to properly flex my creative muscles in an academic setting, and this was a great opportunity to be able to do so. 
Dan and I already knew we were going to make a game that was somewhat Bingus-related due to a longstanding and continued inside joke at the OIT helpdesk, where I was a coordinator with Dan up until I started PCEP. Having the initial idea of
"something to do with Bingus" gave us a lot of freedom with what kind of game we wanted to design. The name _Bingusquest_ was originally thought of, and we were planning to do a full top-down RPG style of game, but I'm incredibly pleased with what
we came up with. I also managed to sucker my partner, Chloe Maharg, into drawing some assets for us that's seen in the design doc. They perfectly encapsulate the style we're trying to go for! If given the time and opportuninty, I'd absolutely 
do more design and make a fully fleshed out game. The ideas and design that we did are somewhat silly, but I fully believe that this could become a great game.

## The Prototype
Thomas: I definitely ran into some issues when working on the prototype. I haven't developed in Unity at all previous to working on this project (that's where the challenge for this comes from), and it was a lot to learn pretty quickly. As such, I worked on the first part of the prototype, the "town" section, as it was simpler than the tower defense portion of the game. I learned about player movement, scenes, assets, scripting, and interactions and collisions.
